# CountriesApp

Hi!

Inside this folder you'll find a proyect I developed on the last month of a FullStack bootcamp I did on 2021. Next, I'll explain a bit what it is and show a few pics,
as it is not (yet) deployed.

The app consist of a Development of a SPA (Single Page Application) using React for the Front End, and Redux as state managment. 
The components were developed with CSS without the use of external libraries. 
It consumes data from an API throught a Back End developed in NodeJS using express, adding new functionalities to the original API. 

Some features of the project:

Search Cach√©
Ordering and filtering
Controlled Form for the creation of Turist Activities, wich are stored and linked through middle.tables in the databes by using Sequelize to every API country
